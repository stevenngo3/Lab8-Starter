Graceful degradation and service workers are related because graceful degradation is where we start with max technology while working downwards as we emit pages while still having a functional system. This is basically how service workers process as they first save data requests with the use of the internet, and then service workers are still able to receive the network requests we send out from the web app despite having no network. With service workers, we are still able to have a functional system without needing a network connection, which ties to the definition of graceful degradation.
